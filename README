A collection of various applications of MapReduce. Programs written for Harvard
class CS205: Computing Foundations for Computational Science. Included 
applications of MapReduce include an anagrams finder, an implementation of a
breadth first search, estimation using trapezoidal integration, and an
implemntation of Monte Carlo integration.

anagrams
========
Provided a dictionary of words, this program finds all the possible anagrams 
and outputs the alphabetically ordered version of the word along with all
possible anagrams and the number of anagrams per sorted word. A sample input
text is provided (dictionary.txt) and additionally the output (sampleoutput.txt
file which is produced when you run Anagrams.py on the sample input file.

breadth_first_search
====================
Using the dataset of comic book heroes and the comics they appear in from  the
work by Alberich, Miro-Julia, & Rossello (2002), BFSPrepare.py and SSBFS.py
create a graph based on adjacency and then perform a breadth first search. The
original input file to be used on BFSPrepare.py is labeled_edges.tsv and
provides list of pairs in the format of "CHARACTER NAME", "COMIC ISSUE" meaning
that the character appeared in the associated comic issue. 

BFSPrepare.py
converts the source data into an adjacency list format in which there is a key
for each character name associated with a pair. Each associated pair contains
this character's distance to the origin node and a list of characters that are
also associated with that vertex. 

Source Data example format:
key		value
"Human Robot",	"WI?9"
"Captain America",	"AVF 4"
"Human Robot",	"AVF 4"
"Old Skull",	"AA2 35"

Prepared Data example format:
"Human Robot",	[null,["Captain America"]]
"Captain America",	[0,["Human Robot"]]
"Old Skull",	[null,[]]

SSBFS.py
Takes a graph (like the one outputted in BFSPrepare.py) and performs a single
source breadth first source. BFSGraphOutput.txt is an example of an output
created by this program when the input file is prepared.txt (Provided by Isaac
Slavitt). In order to change the source node, simply edit the distance value of
the character you want to be your source to 0 and run SSBFS on that graph.

trap_integration
================
Uses trapezoidal integration and MapReduce to estimate the value of pi/4. Two
versions are provided- one that demonstrates it simply, and one that uses
in-mapper combining.

monte_carlo
===========
An in-mapper combining implementation of Monte Carlo integration to estimate
the value of pi/4.
